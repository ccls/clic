created new rails 3 app with "rails new clic" in separate directory
then copied in new files and cut-n-paste modifications to existing



about to change <% to <%= in block tags like 
	form_tag
	form_for
	fields_for
	content_tag_for


removing ssl_requirement gem as is forced through server


changed database adapter to mysql2 to stop the ...
/opt/local/lib/ruby1.9/gems/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.1.4/lib/bundler/rubygems_integration.rb:157:in `block in replace_gem': Please install the mysql adapter: `gem install activerecord-mysql-adapter` (can't activate mysql (~> 2.8.1), already activated mysql-2.9.1. Make sure all dependencies are added to Gemfile.) (LoadError)



"rails c" works !

"rails s" doesn't

need to rewrite routes


REMOVE any default_scope stuff, but will need to compensate




routes written.  time to tackle the big stuff
	
	named_scope
	html_safe
	method_missing_without_wrapping in form builder
	removed before_validation_on_create
	validations
	testing mods
	authlogic
		Need to ... to play in console
		 Authlogic::Session::Base.controller = Authlogic::ControllerAdapters::RailsAdapter.new(self)
	active record errors
	replace on_attr_and_type
	remove http/https tests
	replaced RAILS_ROOT with Rails.root
	block_called_from_erb
I think that these were removed in ODMS upgrade
	destroy_link_to
	form_link_to

slowly

something is forcing me to add "attr_protected" to models
	as all attributes are being treated as protected
	commented out "whitelist" in application.rb


tinymce replaced with gem which is so much cleaner

The whole relative root thing should be able to be removed now that clic
won't be a "sub app"




	update all finders to rails 3 / arel / active relation




Will need to add .html_safe to a lot of stuff


everything appears to be working, fingers crossed.
