# Read about fixtures at http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html


#	"Foxy Fixtures" generates ids based on a hash
#	which results in the possibilty of non-unique ids
#	and makes sorting by it pointless
#	We'd need to sort by parent's position which introduces a join
#	for something that should be simple.

#	the "children" really don't need ids as they aren't referenced


#	perhaps I should create a "collection_position" to effectively do 
#	the same thing that the id is doing but would allow for
#	the "foxiness" of using the labels
