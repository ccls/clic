    The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) is an international group of researchers established in 2006 in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with the aim of sharing comparable data from case-control and family-based trio studies on childhood leukemia. Through this joint research, we will coordinate scientific efforts and achieve greater power to elucidate the role of a variety of clinical, infectious, environmental, and genetic risk factors in the etiology of childhood leukemia, especially for rare subtypes.
