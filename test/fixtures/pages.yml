    h1. About Us
    
    h2. Introduction
    
    The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) is an international group of researchers established in 2006 in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with the aim of sharing comparable data from case-control and family-based trio studies on childhood leukemia. The objectives of CLIC are two-fold: (1) to combine existing questionnaire and genotyping data from several case-control studies conducted in Europe, Northern and Southern America, and Asia leading to expected numbers of approximately 8,000 childhood leukemia cases and 14,000 controls; and (2) to foster collaboration with other research teams that are in the planning phase for future studies childhood leukemia.  Through this joint research, we will coordinate scientific efforts and achieve greater power to elucidate the role of a variety of clinical, infectious, environmental, and genetic risk factors in the etiology of childhood leukemia, especially for rare subtypes.
    
    h2. About CLIC
    
    Childhood Leukemia is the leading cancer in children worldwide, yet it is a rare disease compared to adult cancers. The most frequent histological subtype is acute lymphoid leukemia (75%) followed by acute myeloid leukemia (19%).  Its etiology remains largely unknown, mainly due to its biological diversity and the multifactorial etiology involving interactions between genetic and environmental factors. This problem is further compounded when considering leukemia subtypes and specific cytogenetic groups characterized by chromosome changes (i.e., translocation, deletion, hyperdiploidy).
    
    In the short term, the CLIC will pursue pooled analysis of currently available data across the studies. Future directions will include efforts to replicate novel findings, implement coordinated genotyping (this is not limited to genetic susceptibility studies, but should also include tumor genetic and epigenetic analyses), review and establish a standardized pathologic process worldwide, and design new studies in the context of the consortium to test novel hypothesis.  
    
    h4. Mission
    
    The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) is a consortium of scientists involved in childhood leukemia research. CLIC's Mission is to develop and support collaborations between member groups to identify factors that influence the risk of childhood leukemia through epidemiological studies and related research. CLIC encourages free exchange of results (published or unpublished) and ideas in a collegial environment without fear of competition.
    
    h4. Objectives
    
    Within the scope defined by our Mission, the objectives of CLIC are to expand knowledge of the etiology of childhood leukemia through:
    
    # Fostering collaborations between researchers in different countries;
    # Fostering sharing of comparable data from existing/ongoing case-control and family-based trio studies;
    # Fostering collaboration with researchers that are in the planning phase for future studies;
    # Providing a framework for the efficient conduct and publication of pooled and/or replication studies;
    # Providing a forum and framework for discussion, development and pursuit of new research directions; and
    # Supporting the development of early career researchers.

    h2. Study Description
    
    The time periods of recruitment vary between individual studies with commencement year ranging from 1989 to 2003.  About half of the studies are still ongoing.  Tthe majority of the studies are population-based. Most studies have an age criterion of 0 to 14 years, with the exception of the Brazilian study (0-2 yrs), Italian study (<11 years), and the St. Justine and Seoul studies (0-18 yrs).  Most studies have matched on age and sex with some studies also matching on race/ethnicity.  The total estimated target sample size for all studies combined is approximately 8,000 cases and 14,000 controls. A breakdown of the sample size by major leukemia subtypes shows that there are approximately 6,700 B- and T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia and 970 acute myeloid leukemia.
    
    h3. Questionnaire data and DNA sample collection
    
    Regarding data collected through questionnaires, all studies obtain information on parental occupation, smoking, and alcohol consumption.  Most studies obtain information on pesticide use, family history, medical history, and daycare attendance.  Only a few studies obtain information on dietary factors.  DNA samples are available for the child, mother, or father from all studies except those from Germany and Italy.  Across the studies, child DNA is currently available for approximately 4,800 cases and 5,000 controls, and 2,100 case trios (child/mother/father).

    Forms to initiate a pooled analysis proposal
    
    One of the main objectives of the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium is to foster collaborations amongst researchers through pooled analyses to elucidate the role of a variety of clinical, infectious, environmental, and genetic risk factors in the etiology of childhood leukemia, especially for rare subtypes. To facilitate this process, the Data Sharing and Pooled Analyses Core Logistics Group (Lead: Elizabeth Milne) created guidelines and forms for researchers to submit interest and proposals for pooled analyses. These forms were approved by the CLIC Coordination Group (CG) and call for Expressions of Interest for pooled analyses will generally be announced twice each year around Mid-March and Mid-September.
    
    Please carefully review the guidelines, and forms below and submit all forms, questions and/or concerns to the CLIC Central Office at "CLIC_centraloffice@berkeley.edu":mailto:CLIC_centraloffice@berkeley.edu by the appropriate deadlines.

    h2. Pooled analysis on MTHFR gene and maternal folate.
    
    As the first proof of principle for this consortium, a grant proposal was submitted to the National Cancer Institute and successfully funded in October 2007 (grant No. 1R03CA132172-01).  This project proposes to conduct pooled analyses to evaluate the role of the use of folate supplements during pregnancy, maternal alcohol consumption (known to reduce folate bioavailability), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genetic variants in the development of childhood leukemia by histological and cytogenetic subtype, and to assess the interactions between these factors. To achieve these aims, the CLIC will combine data from six studies in Northern California, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia, resulting in over 3,300 cases and 4,400 controls. Data will be pooled centrally at the University of California, Berkeley.

    h2. Interest Groups
    
    The Interest Groups will promote collaborative projects in specific areas of childhood leukemia research (e.g., immunity/infection; environmental/occupation exposures; subtypes of childhood leukemia) There are currently eight Interest Groups (by alphabetical order):
    
    o AML/APL
    o Birth Characteristics
    o Environmental Exposures
    o Family History
    o Genetic Studies
    o Infant Leukemia
    o Infection and Immunity
    o Occupational Exposures
    
    Research on specific topics will be proposed by the Interest Groups to the Coordination Group by completion of the data pooling forms. If the research proposed is supported by the Coordination Group, a Working Group will be established to pursue the proposed research.
    
    It is the responsibility of the Active and Associate CLIC members in the Interest and Core Logistics Groups to name one leader and one co-leader. If deemed necessary, two leaders and two co-leaders may be appointed for additional support. All leadership roles will rotate every year so that everyone who expresses interest in this role can fulfill the position.
    
    Leaders must be members of the Coordination Group (Principal Investigators and designates). It is preferred that co-leaders are members of the Coordination Group, but Active CLIC members who are not part of the Coordination Group can be given exceptional ad hoc status of co-leadership if deemed necessary and appropriate by the group (i.e. expertise, availability).
    
    Participation in Interest Groups, Working Groups, and Core Logistic Groups is open to all CLIC members. Leaders should inform all CLIC members of the activities of the respective Groups at annual meetings.
